# TicTacToe
Created: 06/03/2013

I created this application as an attempt to try my hand at creating a C# Windows Form based game.
It is just a simple 2 player TicTacToe game. I have not incorporated A.I. yet but it does check
for all victory conditions including a draw. It also has a right click context menu to start a new
game or to exit the game all together.
